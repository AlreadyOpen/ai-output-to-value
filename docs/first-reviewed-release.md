# First reviewed release — public acceptance bar

The public site remains a **working preview** until this checklist is satisfied. Passing CI or rendering a green Claim Gate result is not the same as approving the publication.

## Required core instrument

- [ ] The six-claim stop-rule framework is stable enough for the release.
- [ ] The deterministic Claim Gate, schema, and example records are internally consistent.
- [ ] The Claim Gate clearly states that `PASS` evaluates the supplied record and is **not an audit of the underlying system or evidence**.
- [ ] The one-page meeting brief renders and prints correctly.
- [ ] The private workbook is available for confidential organisational use.

## Required teaching material

- [ ] Five worked decisions are included and clearly labelled illustrative where invented.
- [ ] The website prototype demonstrates a weaker decision passing and a stronger decision blocking without changing the artefact.
- [ ] The option-value case shows that learning can be an Outcome without forcing productisation.
- [ ] The software measurement case uses an explicit baseline, after-period, metric definitions, cost boundary, and confound/attribution qualification.

## Required evidence review

The release gate derives review scope from the publication manifest. **Every claim published in a `guide` or `policy` source is review-critical by construction**, even if its record says `launch_critical: false`. Working-only claims enter the review scope when explicitly marked `launch_critical: true`.

Every review-critical claim must have a completed independent review record and an accepting disposition (`accepted`, `accepted_with_qualification`, or `revised_and_accepted`). This includes the prominent evidence used in the first-time reading route, including:

- [ ] METR's early-2025 experienced open-source developer study;
- [ ] the Microsoft/GitHub Copilot controlled HTTP-server experiment;
- [ ] Noy and Zhang's professional-writing experiment;
- [ ] Dell'Acqua et al.'s consulting experiment;
- [ ] DORA software-delivery evidence;
- [ ] the Harvard Business Review workflow source;
- [ ] the Harvard Business Review teamwork source where used in core guidance;
- [ ] Brynjolfsson, Li and Raymond where the customer-support study is used;
- [ ] any other claim published in a `guide` or `policy` source, or explicitly marked `launch_critical: true`.

Every evidence entry must also identify the inspected `source_version` so the reviewed source state can be reconstructed.

A source logo or citation is not itself independent review.

## Publication quality

- [ ] Core-route pages receive rendered desktop/mobile accessibility and usability checks.
- [ ] The generated PDF meeting brief receives a real print/render check.
- [ ] External links and source dates are reviewed.
- [ ] The dedicated social-preview image is present.
- [ ] A small reader test covers Start Here, Claim Gate, Claim Card, worked decisions, and the meeting brief.
- [ ] Working/research essays remain visibly separated from the release guide and do not leak into the reviewed artifact.

## Governance and reuse

- [ ] Code licence is selected and published.
- [ ] Editorial/reference-content licence is selected and published; it may differ from the code licence.
- [ ] Provenance, corrections, confidentiality, and evidence policy are included.
- [ ] The release commit/tag is explicit and reproducible.
- [ ] The manual release approval gate passes before deployment.

## Release statement

Only after the checklist is satisfied should the header move beyond **Working preview**. Even then, the project is an open decision method, not an industry standard, certification, audit opinion, or guarantee that any particular project is fit for use.
