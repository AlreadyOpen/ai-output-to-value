# @alreadyopen/mcp-output-to-value

Native Model Context Protocol access to the **AI Output to Value** decision framework.

This package is the practical agent interface for IDE, desktop and terminal workflows. Gate evaluation is pinned to the contract bundled with the checked-out package by default; publication/search tools still read the selected public publication surface. WebMCP remains a progressive browser enhancement; native MCP does not depend on `document.modelContext`.

## Status

Early package source inside the main repository. It is **not yet published to npm**. The package source is licensed under Apache-2.0 (see the repository `LICENSE`); `package.json` still sets `private: true` until a publishing decision is made.

## Transport

The first supported transport is **stdio**, suitable for local MCP hosts such as IDEs and terminal agents. A remote Streamable HTTP deployment can use the same server factory later.

## Run from this repository

```bash
cd packages/mcp
npm install
npm start
```

The gate tools `get_stop_rule` and `evaluate_claim_record` use the bundled copies of:

- `schemas/v1/decision-gates.json`
- `schemas/v1/claim.schema.json`

This means pinning an MCP checkout to a commit also pins its gate semantics. Each gate result reports `gateVersion` and `rulesSource`; the default source is `bundled`.

Other read-only publication tools use the public publication API at:

`https://alreadyopen.github.io/ai-output-to-value/`

Override that publication host with:

```bash
AIOV_PUBLICATION_URL=https://example.test/ npm start
```

`AIOV_PUBLICATION_URL` by itself does **not** replace the bundled gate contract. To explicitly evaluate against the current gate rules and claim schema from that publication host, opt in with:

```bash
AIOV_PUBLICATION_URL=https://example.test/ AIOV_LIVE_RULES=true npm start
```

With that opt-in, gate results report `rulesSource: "live-publication"`. This mode is intentionally explicit because mutable publication rules would otherwise defeat a commit-pinned MCP checkout.

The package test suite compares the bundled schemas with the canonical repository copies and runs the same conformance fixture used by the Python CLI/Action evaluator. A contract change therefore requires the copies and both evaluator expectations to move together.

## Tools

- `get_stop_rule(decision_type)` — minimum sufficient claim and required checks.
- `evaluate_claim_record(claim)` — validates the supplied record against `claim.schema.json`, then performs deterministic evaluation of the selected gate. It checks the supplied evidence state; it does not independently verify the underlying facts.
- `get_framework()` — current six-claim framework and actor-neutral rule from the selected publication surface.
- `get_software_outcome_template()` — DORA-based software-delivery Outcome measurement pack plus optional AI-specific leading indicators; it marks no check PASS automatically.
- `list_articles(section?)` — articles included in the currently published artifact.
- `search_claims(query, limit?)` — canonical claim records from the current publication artifact.
- `search_failure_modes(query, limit?)` — working software/architecture failure-mode catalogue.

> **Gate ≠ truth.** A green result means the supplied record satisfies the deterministic gate for the selected decision. It is not an audit of the underlying system or evidence.

## Claude Code

For a local checkout, add the stdio server to the project:

```bash
claude mcp add --scope project ai-output-to-value -- \
  node /absolute/path/to/ai-output-to-value/packages/mcp/src/index.mjs

claude mcp list
```

Claude Code's current CLI uses `--` to separate Claude's MCP options from the stdio command and arguments.

## Cursor

Create `.cursor/mcp.json` in the project (or `~/.cursor/mcp.json` for a personal global configuration):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ai-output-to-value": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "/absolute/path/to/ai-output-to-value/packages/mcp/src/index.mjs"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

The same configuration is also available to Cursor CLI.

## VS Code / GitHub Copilot

For a repository-scoped MCP server in VS Code, create `.vscode/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "ai-output-to-value": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "/absolute/path/to/ai-output-to-value/packages/mcp/src/index.mjs"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Start the server from the MCP configuration UI, then use its tools from Copilot Chat in Agent mode.

## Design rule

> **The target decision determines the required gate. Producer identity does not.**

The MCP server therefore does not impose a special penalty merely because work was AI-generated and does not treat human approval as automatic proof of quality.

For governed workflows, pin the repository to a reviewed release/tag or commit rather than assuming `main` is a reviewed instrument.
